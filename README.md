# Automated-System-for-Canteen

PICT Canteen is a place for all the college students to gather for a bite during their short break. The break spans for 15 minutes. Many college students and teachers order their food at a billing counter. This becomes a bottleneck for the crowd gathered. Many people have to wait throughout the break for their chance to come for them to place the order. This further leads many students to opt for breakfasts outside the college. These quick food often might be unhealthy or unhygienic. We try to solve these problems by introducing the app.

### The Complete System

**Java Server** serves the user Android/iOS application by providing with following:
* Send information about currently available food items
* Receive order from the user and store it in the database

**Java Application (for Canteen Management)** allows management to change the available food items within the menu and enclosed category.

**Mobile Application (for Students and Staff)** provides the user the ability to:
* View food items available in the canteen
* Order the items by selecting them and specifying the quantity required
